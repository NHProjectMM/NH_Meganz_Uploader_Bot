## Features üí´
 - Mega accounts are not needed!
 - Uses two download engines for downloading links!
 - Speed improved with heroku and vps too!
 - Parallel downloads are supported! (This means many users can use the bot at the same time. üòá)
 - Multitasking is also supported! (This means You (owner) and telegram users who you set as auth users will be able to download multiple links at the same time! üòã)
 - Custom thumbnail support!
 - Custom caption support!
 - Ban unwanted users!
 - See your bot's user count!
 - Broadcast any message to every user of your bot!
 - Ability to download any file under 5GB! (If you provide a pro/business account when deploying there will be no file size limits! üòç)

<b>Notes</b> :- 
1. Due to telegram API limits I can't upload files which are bigger than 2GB so such files will be spliited and uploaded to you!
2. Quota limits can occur if you don't provide a pro/business account!
3. Folder support is not implemented yet but can be added in the near future!

```
```sh  
cd
```
```sh  
wget https://mega.nz/linux/MEGAsync/xUbuntu_20.04/amd64/megacmd-xUbuntu_20.04_amd64.deb
```
```sh  
sudo apt install ./megacmd-xUbuntu_20.04_amd64.deb
```
(Ignore the warning "Download is performed unsandboxed as root as file" if it is shown...Continue with the other steps now!)
```sh  
tmux
``` 
**Now there are two methods to go further!**
- Method 1
  
  - Fork my repo. In the repo go inside to the `sample_config.py` and copy all the code in it. In your forked repo, create a file named `config.py` and paste the whole code in it. 
  - Then edit the values in it with your values! (Inside your `config.py` file you will see the examples of how to edit the fields.)
  - Then execute the below commands. üëá

```sh  
git clone You_forked_repo_url
```
```sh  
apt install python3-pip
```
```sh  
apt install ffmpeg
```
```sh  
cd mega-link-downloader-bot
```
```sh  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh  
python3 bot.py
```
Now If you did everything correctly bot will be running successfully! ü•≥

- Method 2

  - Execute the below commands. üëá

```sh  
git clone https://github.com/XMYSTERlOUSX/mega-link-downloader-bot

```sh  
cd mega-link-downloader-bot
```
```sh  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh  
cp sample_config.py config.py
```
```sh  
nano config.py
```
  - Now you will be inside the `config.py` file.
  - Then edit the values in it with your values! (Inside your `config.py` file you will see the examples of how to edit the fields.)
  - (For pasting letters, copy any value you want and take the curser to the place you want by arrow keys and right click the mouse! üòÖ)
  - After editing all with appropriate values as mentioned in the config file press Ctrl + X from your keyboard.
  - Then press y in your keyboard.
